# PowerShell Function Provider Template

This template repository is intended to quickly create a
PowerShell function based provider.

## Getting Started

The `MyProvider` package provider can be imported and works without any changes.
The package and sources returned are examples to show how those are returned.

To modify the template into your own package provider.

1. Rename `MyProvider.psd1` and `MyProvider.psm1` to your provider name.
2. Find and replace `MyProvider` with your provider name.
3. Read the `MyProvider.psm1` comments to update the provider.
4. Add other interfaces to support other cmdlets.
